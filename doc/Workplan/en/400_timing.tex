% The work behind this dissertation is planned to follow the next timing description:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{November 2012 to December 2012 : }

	\sudoindent Literature search for the state of the art and analysis of previous implementations on heterogeneous systems;

\item \textbf{January 2013 to February 2013 : }

	\sudoindent Implementation and profiling of the application:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item in a \textbf{CPU+GPU}, using a Fermi GPU, environment with CUDA;
		\item in a \textbf{CPU+GPU}, using a Kepler GPU, environment with CUDA;
		\item in a \textbf{CPU+Xeon Phi} environment.
	\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{March 2013 to April 2013}

	\sudoindent Hand tune/optimize the kinematical reconstruction code for the heterogeneous platform;

\item \textbf{May 2013}

	\sudoindent Perform a comparative evaluation of the:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{CPU+GPU}, both using Fermi or Kepler GPUs, approach and the \textbf{CPU+Xeon Phi} alternative;
		\item both \textbf{CPU+GPU} alternatives and the \textbf{CPU+Xeon Phi} approach against an alternative one using a framework to abstract the execution management in a heterogeneous platform (e.g. GAMA);

\item \textbf{June 2013}

	\sudoindent Writing up the dissertation.
